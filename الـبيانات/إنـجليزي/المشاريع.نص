## Alusus Programming Language

General purpose programming language, that is extensible by end users through the use of third party
libraries or from inside the end user's program itself. The goal of the language is to allow users to:
* Expand vertically to cover low level features like those in C++ as well as high level features like
  those found in languages like Python or TypeScript.
* Expand horizontally to cover all aspects of programming which saves the user having to use more than
  one language.
* Allow anyone to enhance the language in a decentralized way, which allows users to develop new
  programming techniques or paradigms without having to start from scratch with a new language.

Currently, Alusus Language supports developing desktop apps, command line tools, web apps, database
access, in addition to game programming, and it currently works on Linux and macOS. Builds exist for
x86 and ARM architectures for both 32 and 64 bits.

I designed the language and I developed the compiler using C++17 and STL, and I am currently leading
the project, which sees contribution from few other engineers.

## Web Platform

A platform for developing full stack web apps using Alusus Language. The platform allows the user
to build both the backend and the frontend in Alusus, and it minimizes the borderline between the
frontend and the backend, making web development feel more like desktop GUI development.

I am the main developer on the project. The project is built using:
* Alusus Language
* WebAssembly
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* binaryen
* wabt

## Promises

A library to provide support for Promises in Alusus Language. The library provides promises functionality
but does not provide an event loop, instead the platform where the promises are used is responsible for
providing an event loop, since event loops are tightly related to the environment in which the app runs.
Web Platform provides an event loop that works with this library.

The library was built using Alusus Language.

## Rows

An ORM library for Alusus Language. The library supports defining DB tables as classes and it allows
reading and writing to those tables with support for where and order clauses.

The library was built using Alusus Language and it currently supports PostgresSQL, MySQL as well as
SQLite.

## Jameel

A source code beautifier tool. The tool is not tied to a specific language, instead rules can be
added to it to support any programming language. Currently the tool supports Alusus as well as
JSON files.

The tool is built using Alusus Language and it currently supports Linux and macOS.

## Sayf in Math City

An educational game to teach math to kids in a fun and adventurous atmosphere. The game was originally
developed in the 1990s on Windows 3.1 using C language and I was responsible for the game-play programming
and we lately re-developed the game from scratch using Alusus Language to bring it to modern platforms.
I an responsible for building the framework of the new code base. I am currently working on integrating
it with Web Platform to bring it to the web.

## LogicCAD

This was my graduation project from the college of computer engineering. It's a simulation software
for logic circuits, which allows designing and running logic circuits. The software includes basic
logic gates like AND and OR among others, and it allows the user to built new components that can
then be re-used to build bigger and more complicated circuits.

The software was built for MS Windows using C++ and MFC.
