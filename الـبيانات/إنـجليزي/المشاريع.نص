## Alusus Programming Language

General purpose programming language, that is extensible by end users through the use of third party
libraries or from inside the end user's program itself. Goals of the language:
* Allow users to expand it vertically to support higher level features.
* Allow users to expand it horizontally to cover all areas and industries.
* Allow expanding the language in a decentralized way.

Currently, Alusus libs exist for desktop apps, command line tools, web apps, database access,
in addition to game programming. Alusus builds currently exist for x86 32 & 64 bit Linux, ARM 32 & 64 bit
Linux, and x86 64 bit macOS.

## Web Platform

A platform for developing full stack web apps using Alusus Language. The platform allows the user
to build both the backend and the frontend in Alusus and in a single project making web development
feel more like desktop GUI development. It's built using Alusus, WASM, JS, HTML, CSS, binaryen, and
wabt.

## Promises

A template based Promises libraray for Alusus. It implements strongly typed promises with supports
for chaining promises, catching errors, as well as forking and merging promises. It does not provide
an event loop and expects the platform to provide it. Web Platform provides an event loop that works
with this library.

## Sayf in Math City

An educational game to teach math to kids in and adventurous atmosphere. The game was originally
developed in the 1990s on Windows 3.1 using C language and I was responsible for the game-play programming
and we lately re-developed the game from scratch using Alusus Language to bring it to modern platforms.
I am responsible for building the framework of the new code base. I am currently working on integrating
it with Web Platform to bring it to the web.

## LogicCAD

This was my graduation project. It's a simulation software for logic circuits, which allows designing
and running logic circuits. The software includes basic logic gates like AND and OR among others, and
it allows the user to build new components that can then be re-used to build bigger and more
complicated circuits. It was built for MS Windows using C++ and MFC.
